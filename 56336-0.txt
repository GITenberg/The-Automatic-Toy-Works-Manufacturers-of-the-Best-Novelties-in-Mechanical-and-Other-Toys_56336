TO THE TRADE.

SPRING, 1882.


We present this revised and enlarged edition of our Illustrated Catalogue
to the Trade, confidently believing that it will be of service in the
selection of MECHANICAL TOYS and NOVELTIES which have gained so great
favor and are now so popular in this country and abroad. In style, finish
and dress of our figures, we have made very many improvements and have
added several new kinds to our list. In the partiality which has been
universally shown in favor of our Toys, and the constantly increasing
demand for them, we find an incentive to more than sustain their
reputation in the future.

The Toys represented in this Catalogue are all mechanical and are set in
motion, on being wound up, by patent movements.

Each Toy is packed in a substantial wooden box, and will be sent,
postpaid, to any address on receipt of price, where our goods are not
found with dealers.

Discount rates sent to the trade on application.

The Mechanical Bear.


[Illustration]

This wonderful toy imitates the movements of a bear, by means of
clock-work, in the most life-like manner. The bear rises up on its hind
legs, turns its head from side to side, growls, moves its paws, and
snaps its jaws together. At intervals it gets down on its fore-paws and
goes through similar motions. It runs a long time, and while going it is
difficult to believe it is not alive. It is elegantly made, and covered
with fine fur. The mechanism is so strong and perfect, that only the
greatest abuse can put it out of order. It amuses old as well as young,
and is exceedingly attractive for a show window. It is conceded to be one
of the most ingenious toys ever invented, on account of its variety of
motion and resemblance to nature. Made in black and white fur.

                                                          _Price, $4.25._




THE

Mechanical Sewing-Machine Girl

THE DELIGHT OF ALL GIRLS.—A CHARMING TOY, AND BEAUTIFULLY FINISHED


[Illustration]

A little girl is seated at a cabinet sewing-machine. On winding up the
mechanism her feet begin to work the treadle, and the sewing-machine
begins to sew rapidly; she leans forward, puts the work in position,
watches it, occasionally rising up and bringing the work up to examine
it. These movements are repeated for a long time. The little figure is
elegantly dressed in the latest fashion. It combines the attractiveness
of a beautiful French doll with the interest of life-like motion.

                                                          _Price, $3.50._




Old Uncle Tom,

THE COLORED FIDDLER.


[Illustration]

We consider this toy one of the most comically quaint of anything yet
made. When seen in motion, laughter is irresistible. The old fellow
commences the performance by slowly rocking backward and forward, as if
debating what he should play, then suddenly he strikes his “favorite,”
and rolling his head from side to side, fiddles in an ecstacy of
enjoyment. Funny as it is, there is something almost pathetic in it, too.
This toy is well and carefully made, and with ordinary care will last for
years.

                                                          _Price, $2.50._




The Celebrated Negro Preacher.


[Illustration]

He stands behind a desk, and slowly straightening himself up, turns his
head from side to side and gestures vigorously with his arm. As he warms
to his work, he leans forward over the pulpit, and shakes his head and
hand at the audience, and vigorously thumps the desk. The motions are
so life-like and comical that one almost believes that he is actually
speaking. The face and dress alone provoke irresistible laughter. He
preaches as long as any preacher ought to, and stops when he gets through.

                                                          _Price, $2.50._




Our New Clergyman.

BRUDDER GARDNER.


[Illustration]

The description on the opposite page applies to this brudder also.

                                                          _Price, $2.50._




Old Aunt Chloe,

THE NEGRO WASHERWOMAN.


[Illustration]

Old Aunt Chloe demonstrates that happiness may be found in a wash tub as
well as in a palace. She is faithful at her toil, and we commend her to
our young ladies as an artist of no mean pretentions, after whom they may
pattern if they choose to revive and become proficient in one of the lost
accomplishments.

                                                          _Price, $2.50._




The Old Nurse.


[Illustration]

This mechanical toy is made to imitate an old negro nurse with a child.
Her motions are as natural as life. She holds the child in her hands and
when the mechanism is started, (by being wound) she leans backward and
forward tossing the child up and down in a most surprising manner. This
is a very pleasing toy for children and is very popular.

                                                          _Price, $2.50._




Fing Wing,

A MELICAN MAN.


[Illustration]

This image, with its shaven head, long queue and quaint looking dress,
gives a striking and life-like picture of a Chinese Laundryman. When at
work, he bends over the tub, and rubs the garment which he holds in his
hands with a naturalness so perfect he might easily be mistaken for a
real Celestial.

                                                          _Price, $2.50._




Ah-Sin.

“THE HEATHEN CHINESE.”


[Illustration]

This piece is similar to the Laundryman represented on the opposite
page. It shows Ah-Sin with a smoothing iron, putting the polish upon a
gentleman’s linen. The mechanism of these novelties is so perfectly made,
that only the greatest abuse can put them out of order.

                                                          _Price, $2.50._




The Coaster.


[Illustration]

A simple and attractive toy for small boys. Represents a colored boy on
his sled, which, by means of a mechanical movement, when wound up, goes
skimming along in a direct line, or in circles, according to the setting
of a steering apparatus, attached to the rear of the sled. Nicely packed
in a neat wooden box.

                                                          _Price, $1.00._




The Drummer Boy.


[Illustration]

This is also an attractive piece for small boys. It consists of a
three-wheeled carriage, which supports the figure of a little man with
cymbals and drum, which are alternately struck and beaten as the wheels
revolve by propulsion.

                                                          _Price, $1.00._




The Scissors Grinder.


[Illustration]

A QUAINT AND AMUSING TOY.

A man grinding scissors. When wound up he holds his scissors against the
rapidly revolving stone, at the same time working the treadle with his
leg. He stoops over his work, at intervals straightens up, and examines
the scissors. It is very entertaining.

                                                          _Price, $2.00._




The Woman’s Rights Advocate.


[Illustration]

In presenting this advocate to the public, and remembering with
satisfaction the cordial reception our sterner suffragists and preachers
have received, and believing in every respect she is their equal, we
shall hope to receive as many calls for her. This woman will not insist
upon the last word. Societies supplied with advocates on short notice.

                                                          _Price, $2.50._




The Artist at his Work.


[Illustration]

This figure represents an artist in his studio in an effort to surpass
Raphael. He is dressed in his morning gown and smoking cap, and appears
to be very much engaged with his painting. He surveys, in different
lights, his incompleted work of art, which rests on a small easel,
and then commences to paint with all the confidence of one of the old
masters. This is a deservedly popular toy.

                                                          _Price, $3.00._




Grandmother Rocking Cradle.


[Illustration]

This domestic picture is perfect in miniature. No grandmother, with
all her experience, ever rocked a cradle more naturally or with more
tranquilizing effect. While she rocks the cradle with her foot, with one
hand she fans the infant sleeper, and with the other hand wipes her face
with the handkerchief, and occasionally turns her head and views the
situation with approval.

This is a combination of the toys most coveted by little girls.

                                                          _Price, $3.50._




The Italian Organ Grinder.


[Illustration]

This devotee of classical music discourses several popular airs, in
perfect imitation of his larger brethren. While turning the crank he
occasionally shakes his head at the monkey which dances upon the organ,
and frequently passes his little cap for contributions. The musical
instrument is of the best Swiss manufacture.

                                                          _Price, $6.00._




A Wonderful Creeping Baby.

THE BEST DOLL EVER MADE.


[Illustration]

This unique toy, when wound up, creeps and imitates the movements of a
baby in the most natural manner, moving its hands and feet alternately
as it passes along, and as it occasionally turns its face towards the
spectator, the resemblance to life is almost startling. Delights and
pleases both old and young. Durably and elegantly made. Each doll is
carefully packed in a substantial wooden box. Parents and friends of
little girls send for one of these delightful dolls.

                                                          _Price, $5.00._




It is the aim of the AUTOMATIC TOY WORKS to excel all other manufacturers
in Artistic Designs, Strength and Durability of Construction and Elegance
of Finish.

Foremost in the field with new novelties.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
